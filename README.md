Presidential Pardons
====================

How has the use of the presidential pardon by the US president changed
over time?

According to Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the US Constitution the
acting US President has the power to issue a full pardon, reversing a
criminal conviction for a federal offense (along with its legal effects)
as if it never happened.

The Office of the Pardon Attorney was created in 1981, and the records
from president George H.W. Bush are now listed.

I want to examine the recent records of granted pardons and understand
how this pardon power has changed in use and frequency.
